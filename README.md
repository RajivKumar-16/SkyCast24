## Technologies Used

- âœ… **HTML5**, **CSS3**
- âœ… **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**
- âœ… **Open-Meteo API** â€“ for weather forecast data

## Weather Icons Mapping

SkyCast24 uses two JSON files:

- `weather-icon-night.json`

These map Open-Meteo weather codes (0â€“99) to the corresponding Erik Flowers icon classes based on the time of day (day/night).
